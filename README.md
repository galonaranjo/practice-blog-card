### What I learned

I learned more about resetting my stylesheet. With each project I'm slowly refining initial properties to my liking.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning and refining my layout skills. Right now I rely mostly on flexbox, but would like to learn grids for when it'd be most applicable.
